# hello-world
Initial github tutorial
Currently learning how GitHub works, in order to submit my project. 
The goal of my current project is to answer 3 questions:
  1. What leads to a successful baseball club? Power Hitting, average, pitching, or defense?
  2. Do teams need to be balanced? Or do teams need to possess a few of the top players to be successful?
  3. Are player's salaries an indicator of future team success?
